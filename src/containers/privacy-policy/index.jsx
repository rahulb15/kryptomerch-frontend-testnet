//                                 A non-fungible token (NFT) is a digital file

//                                 verification is done using blockchain
//                                 technology. Blockchain technology, simply put,

//                                 of what passes for NFTs is delusion, fueled by
//                                 the hope of a quick return and the belief that
//                                 something can be gotten for nothing (or
//                                 virtually nothing).

//                                 files. In other words, they’re just strings of
//                                 bits. As a string of bits, a digital file has a
//                                 fixed number of bits, with the bit at any
//                                 location in the string having a definite value

//                                 Fungibility is the ability of an asset to be
//                                 interchanged with other individual assets of the
//                                 same kind; it implies equal value between the
//                                 assets. If you own a fungible asset you can
//                                 readily interchange it for another of a similar
//                                 kind. Fungible assets simplify the exchange and
//                                 trade processes, and the best example would be

//                                 “non-fungibility” property of NFTs. The main
//                                 difference between NFTs and Bitcoins is the fact
//                                 that Bitcoins are limited, and fungible (you can
//                                 trade one Bitcoin with another and both have the
//                                 same value and price). NFTs are unique but
//                                 unlimited, and non-fungible (no two artworks are
//                                 the same). While NFTs can appreciate in value
//                                 (just like real estate), they cannot be
//                                 interchanged for another NFT.

        <p>
            Throughout this Privacy Policy, certain terms carry specific
            meanings that are essential to understanding your rights and our
            obligations:
        </p>
        <p>
            "Personal Data" encompasses any information relating to an
            identified or identifiable individual, including but not limited to
            names, email addresses, postal addresses, telephone numbers,
            financial information, blockchain addresses, authentication
            credentials, and any other information that either directly
            identifies you or could be reasonably combined with other
            information to identify you as an individual.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Anonymous Data" refers to information that has been processed,
            aggregated, or otherwise modified in such a way that it cannot,
            either alone or in combination with other available information, be
            used to identify any individual person or entity. This includes
            statistical data about user behavior that has been stripped of
            personally identifying characteristics.
        </p>
        <p>
            "NFT" (Non-Fungible Token) refers to unique digital assets
            implemented on blockchain technology, which utilize smart contracts
            to establish ownership, authenticity, and association with specific
            digital or physical content. These tokens may represent digital art,
            collectibles, or other forms of digital assets available through our
            Service.
